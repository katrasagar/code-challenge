#Speeding Demerit Points Calculator
This is a simple JavaScript program to calculate demerit points for speeding violations.


##How it Works
The program takes the speed of a car as input (in kilometers per hour) and calculates the demerit points based on the following rules:

The speed limit is set to 70 km/h.
For every 5 km/h over the speed limit, one demerit point is issued.
If the calculated demerit points exceed 12, the license is suspended.
If the speed is within the speed limit, the program prints "Ok".
If the demerit points exceed the maximum limit, the program prints "License suspended".
Otherwise, it prints the number of demerit points.

###How to Use
Run the program.
Enter the speed of the car when prompted (in km/h).
The program will then calculate and display the demerit points or any relevant messages.
