#Student Grade Generator
This is a simple JavaScript program to generate grades based on student marks.

##How it Works
The program takes the mark of a student as input and generates the corresponding grade based on the following criteria:

If the mark is greater than 79, the grade is 'A'.
If the mark is between 60 and 79 (inclusive), the grade is 'B'.
If the mark is between 50 and 59 (inclusive), the grade is 'C'.
If the mark is between 40 and 49 (inclusive), the grade is 'D'.
Otherwise, the grade is 'E'.

##How to Use
Run the program.
Enter the student's mark when prompted (0-100).
The program will then generate and display the corresponding grade.
